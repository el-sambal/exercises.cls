Prove that for all $n\in\N_0$, for all finite sets $A_1,A_2,\dots,A_n$, \[\left|\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\right| = \sum_{\emptyset\neq J\subseteq\{1,\dots,n\}}(-1)^{|J|+1}\left|\bigcap_{j\in J}A_j\right|.\]

\begin{solution}
	Observe that the statement is true for $n=0$ (as $|\emptyset|=0$) and $n=1$ (as $|A_1|=|A_1|$ for all finite sets $A_1$).

	Now we prove the statement for $n=2$. The statement expands to \[\text{for all finite sets $A_1, A_2$:}~~~|A_1\cup A_2|=|A_1|+|A_2|-|A_1\cap A_2|.\]
	Take arbitrary finite sets $A_1, A_2$. Observe that $A_1\cup A_2=A_1\cup(A_2\setminus A_1)$. As $A_1$ and $A_2\setminus A_1$ are disjoint and $A_1$ and $A_2$ are finite, we have $|A_1\cup A_2| = |A_1|+|A_2\setminus A_1|$.

	Also observe that $A_2=(A_2\setminus A_1)\cup(A_2\cap A_1)$ and that $(A_2\setminus A_1)$ and $(A_2\cap A_1)$ are disjoint, so we have $|A_2|=|A_2\setminus A_1|+|A_2\cap A_1|$.

	Combining the two results, we find that $|A_1\cup A_2|=|A_1|+|A_2|-|A_1\cap A_2|$, which proves the case $n=2$.

	We proceed using mathematical induction to prove the statement for all $n\geq2$. We have already proved the case $n=2$ and will use it as a base case.

	Assume as induction hypothesis that the statement holds for some $n=k\geq2$. We have to show that it holds for $n=k+1$. That is, we have to show that for all finite sets $A_1,A_2,\dots,A_{k+1}$, \[\left|\bigcup_{i=1}^{k+1} A_i\right| = \sum_{\emptyset\neq J\subseteq\{1,\dots,k+1\}}(-1)^{|J|+1}\left|\bigcap_{j\in J}A_j\right|.\]
	We can reach the right-hand side from the left-hand side as follows:

	Thus, the statement holds for $n=k+1$. Hence, the statement is proven for all $n\geq2$ by mathematical induction. We showed separately that it holds for $n\in\{0,1\}$ too. This completes the proof.
