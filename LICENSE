I'd be happy if someone (re)uses this project.

Do note that the code uses an idea from the `tcolorbox` manual and from a StackExchange answer. The respective locations are marked with comments in the code, containing proper references. I think the code in this project is sufficiently different so that there is no copyright issue, but still it would be respectful to keep these referencing comments in the code. Thank you.
